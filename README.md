# Background Image

This CSS let's you change the background of Kirka's home page by removing the blue radial glow from the center and also removing the default patterned overlay.

## [INSTALLATION]

- Click on the green button titled 'Code' on this github page. Click on 'Download ZIP' when the pop-up appears so. Skip this step if you've already downloaded the files.

- Open the CSS file downloaded using Notepad and copy the entire text given.

- Install [Live editor for CSS, Less & Sass - Magic CSS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-editor-for-css-less/ifhikkcafabcgolfjegfcgloomalapol?hl=en) from Google Chrome Store.

- Visit [Kirka.io](https://kirka.io).

- Open the extension while being on Kirka and paste in the extension window, the text that was copied from the notepad file.

- Click the pin icon on the top border to automatically load the CSS (without loading the extension), the next time the page is visited. Close the extension with the little X on the top right of the extension window.

- The changes have been applied. The background can now be changed as desired.

## [CHANGING THE BACKGROUND]

- Open the Magic CSS extension.

- Find the line of code shown below in the image.

- Replace the --link-- in the double quotes with the URL of the image you want to use. For eg. https://iili.io/WwhFkl.jpg. 

- Please note that using an image with a resolution of 1920x1080 is best suited for the purpose of applying it as a background.
